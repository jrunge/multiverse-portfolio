# Multiverse Portfolio

This is a refactor of the html5up Multiverse template from jQuery and SASS to React and styled-components. It's still a work in progress, but the intended use is a portfolio/showcase site.

A current demo can be found [here](https://jrunge.github.io/multiverse-portfolio/)

The site is built using react-static and can be run in development mode with hot module reloading or built for production hosting.

### Running in development mode

- install all dependencies using yarn
- start the server by running `yarn start`
- the site will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### Building for production

- install all dependencies using yarn
- build assets by running `yarn build`
- assets will be available in the `docs` directory
